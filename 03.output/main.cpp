{
    // C++ Output (Print Text)
    cout << "Hello World!";
    cout << "I am learning C++";
    cout << "\n\n";
    // C++ Output - New Lines
    // To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:
    cout << "Hello World! C++ from new line \n";
    cout << "C++/CPP out";

    // Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:
    cout << "Text After Blank Space \n\n";

    // Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:
    cout << "Hello World! new line with endl manipulator" << endl;
    return 0;
}

/*
Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.

\n and endl - creates a line break
\t - Creates a horizontal tab
\\ - Inserts a backslash character (\)
\" - Inserts a double quote character
